// the main() program is always the first code which runs in a rust exectuable file
fn main(){
    println!("Hello cargo!");
}

// rustc main.rs -> compiles the program and creates a executable file
// ./main.rs -> runs the executable file


// println! is a rust macro, if it was a function, it would've been println
// macros: are a way to write code, which expands into more code to extend Rust syntax
